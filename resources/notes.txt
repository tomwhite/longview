Easter

Produce a postcard view of Easter from 2000 - 2100 (21st century)...

* Useful - find out date
* Minimal - not cluttered (see Visual Display...)
* Informational - see span of Easter dates (March 22 - April 25).
* Beautiful - superellipses
* Accurate - double checking algorithm
* New - interesting way of looking at a long span of time
